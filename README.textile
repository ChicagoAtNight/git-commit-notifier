h1. Git Commit Notifier

__by Bodo Tasche (bodo 'at' wannawork 'dot' de), Csoma Zoltan (Primalgrasp) (zoltan 'at' primalgrasp 'dot' com)__

Sends email commit messages splitting commits that were pushed in one step. 
Email is delivered as text or HTML with changes refined per word. Emails 
have a scanable subject containing the first sentence of the commit as well 
as the author, project and branch name.

For example:

<pre>[rails][master] Fix Brasilia timezone. [#1180 state:resolved] </pre>

A reply-to header is added containing the author of the commit. This makes 
follow up really simple. If multiple commits are pushed at once, emails are 
numbered in chronological order:

<pre> [rails][master][000] Added deprecated warning messages to Float#months and Float#years deprications.
 [rails][master][001] Enhance testing for fractional days and weeks. Update changelog.</pre>

Example email:

h1. Requirements

* Ruby
* RubyGems
* diff/lcs gem
* SMTP server or sendmail compatible mailer
* mocha, hpricot gems for testing

h1. Installing and Configuring

Before installing the Git Commit Notification script, make sure the following 
Git settings are configured correctly.

* git config hooks.mailinglist (email address of the recipient, probably your mailing list address)
* __Optional:__ git config hooks.emailprefix (application name, used in email subject)

Run the automated installation script:

<pre>sudo gem install git-commit-notifier</pre>

After you installed the gem, you need to configure your git repository. Add a File called 
"post-receive" to the "hooks" directory of your git repository and add this content:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
git-commit-notifier path_to_config.yml
</pre>
(Don't forget to make that file executable.)

An example for the config file can be found in <a href="http://github.com/bodo/git-commit-notifier/blob/master/config/git-notifier-config.yml.sample">config/git-notifier-config.yml.sample</a>.
