h1. Git Commit Notifier

__by Bodo Tasche (bodo 'at' wannawork 'dot' de), Csoma Zoltan (Primalgrasp) (zoltan 'at' primalgrasp 'dot' com)__

Sends email commit messages splitting commits that were pushed in one step. 
Email is delivered as text or HTML with changes refined per word. Emails 
have a scanable subject containing the first sentence of the commit as well 
as the author, project and branch name.

For example:

<pre>[rails][branch] Fix Brasilia timezone. [#1180 state:resolved] </pre>

A reply-to header is added containing the author of the commit. This makes 
follow up really simple. If multiple commits are pushed at once, emails are 
numbered in chronological order:

<pre> [rails][branch][000] Added deprecated warning messages to Float#months and Float#years deprications.
 [rails][branch][001] Enhance testing for fractional days and weeks. Update changelog.</pre>

Example email:

h2. Requirements

* Ruby
* RubyGems

h2. Installing and Configuring

Install the gem:

<pre>sudo gem install git-commit-notifier</pre>

After you installed the gem, you need to configure your git repository. Add a file called 
"post-receive" to the "hooks" directory of your git repository with this content:

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
git-commit-notifier path_to_config.yml
</pre>
(Don't forget to make that file executable.)

An example for the config file can be found in <a href="http://github.com/bitboxer/git-commit-notifier/blob/master/config/git-notifier-config.yml.sample">config/git-notifier-config.yml.sample</a>.

h2. Integration with Redmine, Bugzilla, MediaWiki

This product supports easy integration with Redmine, Bugzilla and
MediaWiki as You can see in example of the config file.

All you need is to uncomment required software line and print links
to your software installations instead of example links.

h2. Integration of links to other software

If you need integration with any other software use message_map property.

Each key of message_map is a case sensitive Regexp pattern, and its value is the replacement 
string. Backreferences to match groups of given Regexp supported through \1-\9 expressions.

See also http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html#M000817 and in example of the config file.

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
